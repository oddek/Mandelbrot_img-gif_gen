# Mandelbrot image and gif generator #

![](Eksempel.gif)

## Image:
Creates an image of a given size in a given area of the mandelbrot set. With a given number of iterations over z.

## Gif:
Creates a gif of user defined number of frames, which zooms into a given point into the mandelbrot set. The problem is that you can't zoom very deep without increasing the iterations, and when iterations > 1000, things start to get really slow.

## Libraries used:
[Lodepng](https://github.com/lvandeve/lodepng#lodepng)
[gif.h](https://github.com/ginsweater/gif-h)
